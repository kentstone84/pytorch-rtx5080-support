# pytorch-rtx5080-support
Unlock full RTX 5080 performance in PyTorch! PyTorch does not support RTX 5080 (sm_120) natively, so I built custom CUDA 12.8 drivers and PyTorch binaries to make it work. This repo contains build scripts, benchmarks, and installation guides for running AI models at max efficiency on the RTX 5080.
